URL Configuration — Project Level Router
-----------------------------------------
This is the TOP LEVEL url router for the entire Django project.
Every incoming request hits this file first before going anywhere else.

This file does NOT handle requests directly — it reads the URL and
hands the request off to the correct app to handle it.

Think of this file as a switchboard operator:
  - Request comes in
  - This file reads the URL
  - Forwards it to the right app based on the URL prefix

Works with:
  - event_handler/urls.py — handles all /api/ requests
  - Django's built in admin panel — handles all /admin/ requests

URL flow example:
  Browser hits /api/motion/
      ↓
  This file sees /api/ → hands off to event_handler/urls.py
      ↓
  event_handler/urls.py sees /motion/ → calls motion_detected view
